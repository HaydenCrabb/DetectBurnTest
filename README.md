# DetectBurnTest
A project which utilizes a stack to identify burned trees. This is a test project of a image classifier. 

### Code
The Stack.h file and StackNode.h files are external files that I created to be used on any project. They are utilized here to operate the stack.

The tree.asc file is a test file that can be used to test the program.
